> ### [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://conduit-re-frame-demo.netlify.com/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Demo with re-frame-10x](https://jacekschae.github.io/conduit-re-frame-10x-demo/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Demo with re-frisk](https://flexsurfer.github.io/conduit-re-frisk-demo/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with
[ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), including CRUD operations,
authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the
[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
