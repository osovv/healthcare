;; -- Interceptors --------------------------------------------------------------
;; Every event handler can be "wrapped" in a chain of interceptors. Each of these
;; interceptors can do things "before" and/or "after" the event handler is executed.
;; They are like the "middleware" of web servers, wrapping around the "handler".
;; Interceptors are a useful way of factoring out commonality (across event
;; handlers) and looking after cross-cutting concerns like logging or validation.
;;
;; They are also used to "inject" values into the `coeffects` parameter of
;; an event handler, when that handler needs access to certain resources.
;;
;; Each event handler can have its own chain of interceptors. Below we create
;; the interceptor chain shared by all event handlers which manipulate user.
;; A chain of interceptors is a vector.
;; Explanation of `trim-v` is given further below.

                           trim-v])            ;; removes first (event id) element from the event vec

;; After logging out, clean up local-storage so that when a user refreshes
;; the browser she/he is not automatically logged-in, and because it's
